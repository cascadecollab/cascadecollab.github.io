        You will be given a segment of the final illustration to work on. In order to ensure all the segments merge properly
        you must not change the resolution of the given segment.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        The output format must be a transparent PNG with the character, and a separate PNG with the "shadow" that connects through the entire illustration.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Who can participate?</h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        Cascade Collab welcomes artists of all skill levels, celebrating a diverse range of styles and creative expressions. 
        However, to ensure a good quality final piece, applicants should meet a minimum standard of artistic proficiency, 
        including solid fundamentals such as anatomy and composition.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 font-bold">The use of AI is strictly prohibited.</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        The styles that I want to showcase are those styles produced by actual humans, not synthetic ones produced by AI tools.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Selection Process</h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        I will personally review your past works to determine if you meet the minimum standard. I will also consult some artists
        that I trust for those cases where I'm not so sure.<br>
        Regardless of whether your application is accepted or denied I will personally reach out to tell you the outcome. If your application is 
        accepted, it will be considered for any of the remaining characters.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        Shortly after the next character to be drawn is announced, I will personally start contacting the potential candidates among the remaining
        accepted applications. Don't worry if I don't contact you, you may have more luck for the next character.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        An additional requirement to participate is be willing to share a link to 
        <a class="text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="/artwork/">The Artwork</a> 
        when you publish the segment you just draw on the platforms you usually publish your art.<br>
        That way people can see the rest of the artwork and meet the other artists that contributed to it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        I also ask you to share the link again once the entire artwork is done (which will likely take a long time).
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        Stay up to date with project's progress on the <a class="text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="/blog/">Blog</a>.
