Today is the day this project officially launches.

I'm very excited to finally start this project that I had in mind for quite some time now. 
I've been working on this website for a few weeks and now it's finally ready.

However, there is still a lot of work to do, for now I'm just going to start spreading the word 
about the project, hoping that people will find it interesting. 

It might be a flop, it might be a success, or anything in between. Whatever the outcome, I'm 
determined to follow through to the end.

After getting the word out there I'm going to announce the first character to be drawn probably in April.
But of course there are many other factors in play, such as the number of applications received or the 
artists availability, so I can't guarantee any specific timeline.

See you in the next update!
