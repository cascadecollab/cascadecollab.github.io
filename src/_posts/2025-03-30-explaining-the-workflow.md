Today I'm going to explain how I'm going to arrange all the segments of the illustration to ensure a seamless transition.

The process is actually quite simple, each artist will deliver a transparent PNG with the finished character, the full body. Then, I will split it in two parts, right before it intersects with the next character. The bottom slice will then be combined with the reference for the next character. Here's a graphic to help visualize it:

After I have the PNG for the second character I can seamlessly merge it with the top slice of the previous character, then cut it again at a different point to get [segment #1](/assets/artwork/1.png).

This process will repeat for every character, with some exceptions, like the characters hugging at [segment #6](/assets/artwork/6.png).

So, basically it's just a lot of splitting and merging. If done correctly it ensures a fully seamless transition, down to the pixel. There's a limitation with this process though, the characters have to be done sequentially, top to bottom. Therefore, a character cannot be started until the previous one is done. Which is acceptable because even if multiple characters could be done in parallel, there's a limit to how much I can spend on this each month.

Next week I will be announcing who will be the first character to be drawn.

See ya!
