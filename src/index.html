    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        Cascade Collab is a collaborative art project where multiple artists contribute to a vertically stacked
        artwork, each drawing a segment in their own unique style. Inspired by the iconic <a class="text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/durarara-ending-parodies" target="_blank">Durarara! ending meme</a>, the goal is
        to showcase artistic diversity in a seamless flow.
