    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        Each artist will draw a segment of the artwork in their own style, one character per artist,
        with the only exception being the two characters hugging in <a class="text-blue-500 hover:underline" 
            href="/assets/artwork/6.png" target="_blank">segment 6</a>.<br>
        Therefore, there are a total of 14 slots, rather than 15.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        The artists will be compensated for their work using their standard rate for commissions, 
        unless a different price is negotiated individually.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Why?</h2>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        Why not? To be honest, I just think it will be a really fun experience, while also showcasing art diversity through this big illustration. 
        I also hope to help artists gain more visibility by becoming part of this project.
